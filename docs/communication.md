# Communication Guidelines

This document captures working agreements for language and communication.

## Language Rules

- Assistant responses to the Product Owner (chat): Russian only.
- All project artifacts must be in English, including:
  - Documentation (specs, guides, ADRs, roadmaps)
  - Code (identifiers, comments, strings unless UX copy requires RU)
  - Issues, pull requests, commit messages, and review notes

## Clarifications

- When referencing user requirements originally written in Russian, keep them in Russian and provide an English summary if added to project docs.
- If there is any conflict, prefer Russian in chat with the PO and English in all persistent project artifacts.
- UX-facing copy language decisions are handled in product specs; default to English unless explicitly specified otherwise.

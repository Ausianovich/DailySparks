# Product Vision — DailySpark

## Problem
Adults 30+ struggle with light, engaging small talk in everyday social settings, leading to awkwardness, stress, and repetitive conversations.

## Audience
- Couples 30–50, with kids or household routines
- Singles 30–45, re-entering dating or expanding social circle
- Introverts across both segments seeking low-stakes practice

## Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)
- When going to a social event, quickly get 3–5 fresh, safe conversation starters tailored to context and audience.
- When feeling rusty socially, practice a short, realistic dialogue with feedback, in private and without judgment.
- Build confidence and conversational agility through micro-lessons personalized by recent practice.

## Value Proposition
DailySpark provides instant, relevant “sparks” to start or sustain light conversation and an AI practice partner that offers real-time hints and concise feedback.

## Principles
- Simple first: chat and generator as the core.
- Safe and kind: avoid sensitive/charged topics by default.
- Practical and time-efficient: value within 60–90 seconds.
- Personalized over time with clear user control of data.

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- No voice input/output or speech analysis.
- No deep psychological profiling.
- No heavy social network features.

## Success Metrics (MVP hypotheses)
- Spark usage: ≥2 sparks/session, ≥60% sessions include generator use.
- Time-to-value: <30s to first spark.
- Short practice: median 3–6 turns per training session.
- CSAT on sparks and coaching: ≥4.2/5.
- D1 retention (early cohort): ≥25%.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Hallucinations or unsafe content → strong prompt templates, safety filters, and content policy.
- Generic/boring output → context-rich prompts, freshness constraints, topicality injection.
- Latency → compact prompts, caching, and provider choice.
- Privacy concerns → explicit opt-in for data storage; anonymization.
